# Library
This project has been made using the concepts of file handling in C++. It is based on the functioning of a library. This has various features that include maintaining database records of students and books of the library. The program constantly updates the information regarding students and new books being brought in the library. Apart from this, the program maintains a record of the books being issued by people, notifies them regarding the return date of that particular and also the calculates the fine on per day basis to be paid by the issuer, in case he/she misses the return deadline. The program has been made keeping in mind a cap on the number of books that can be issued by a particular student, and hence doesn't allow the particular student to issue a book beyond the allowable limit.
